# 2/3/23 - While we didn’t have school I still worked on the project at home, and I managed to go through 4 chapters of Python on the official Python docs.
# A significant challenge was understanding some of the differences between Python and Java I really struggled to get used to not using parentheses for 
# things like if statements. A concept that was difficult to grasp was for loops that were formatted like the example below the main reason this was a 
# challenge is that I was confused at how it looped through the variables, but eventually, I figured out that it’s just 2 loops without taking up more space 
# this could be used for combining 2 lists using zip. I’m enjoying Python a lot more than Java since everything is a lot faster and shorter to write, also 
# I feel like I’m learning at a much faster rate than I did with Java mainly because I put more effort into it.

Fruit = ["Banana", "Peach", "Apple", "Grape"]
Color = ["Yellow", "Pink", "Red", "Purple"]

for i, v in zip(Fruit, Color):
   print(i + " -> " + v)

# Banana Yellow
# Peach Pink
# Apple Red
# Grape Purple
